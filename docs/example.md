# Example usage of the Moonshot Library

In this example we are going to use the resources in the sample directory.
This example assumes you have access to an Amazon AWS account and have sufficient permissions to create roles and resources.

## So, what's in it for me?

After setup, you will be able to repeatedly deploy a PHP app to one or more
isolated environments on AWS by running the following command:

```shell
$ moonshot push
```

You will also be able to update the OS and supporting software by pulling the
latest changes in this repository and updating the stack with following command:

```shell
$ moonshot update
```

Lastly, you get a disposable, light-weight application that can be used to learn
and hack on Moonshot without having to muck with applications that actually
matter.

## Setup

### Create a service role for Code Deploy in your AWS account.

Create a role called CodeDeployRole with the AWSCodeDeployRole policy

```bash
$ aws iam create-role --role-name CodeDeployRole --assume-role-policy-document '{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "codedeploy.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}'
$ aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name CodeDeployRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSCodeDeployRole
```

If you wish to do this manually, follow the
[Create a Service Role for AWS CodeDeploy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/how-to-create-service-role.html)
documentation, and make sure to name the role `CodeDeployRole` as that is
what Moonshot expects.

### Install Moonshot and it's dependencies.

Moonshot is released as a Ruby gem, and required Ruby 2.1+.

```shell
$ gem install moonshot
```

### Create an S3 bucket and update the sample tools.

First, create your own bucket to put your artifacts in:
```shell
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket moonshot-sample-your-name
```

Then update `Moonfile.rb` to refer to that bucket in the `S3Bucket` configuration.

### Create a configuration for your stack.

We'll have to copy the base stack configuration and modify the ArtifactBucket
parameter so that the instance has access to the release bucket (via the
IAM Role in the CloudFormation stack).

```shell
$ cp cloud_formation/parameters/moonshot-sample-app.yml cloud_formation/parameters/moonshot-sample-app-dev-$USER.yml
```

## Usage of the CLI

Run the following commands to create your environment and deploy code to it.
Note that you will have to set the `AWS_REGION` environment variable prior to
running these commands. If it's not set, it will use the default AWS region
which at the time of this writing is us-east-1.

A detailed explanation of [all the CLI commands can be found in the User Guide](user-guide/cli.md)

You can now deploy your software to a new stack with:

```shell
$ moonshot create
```

By default, you'll get a development environment named `moonshot-sample-app`. If you want to provision test or production
named environment, use:

```shell
$ moonshot create -n my-service-staging
$ moonshot create -n my-service-production
```

By default, create launches the stack and deploys code. If you want to only
create the stack and not deploy code, use:

```shell
$ moonshot create --no-deploy
```

If you make changes to your application and want to release a development build
to your stack, run:

```shell
$ moonshot push
```

To build a "named build" for releasing through test and production environments,
use:

```shell
$ moonshot build v0.1.0
$ moonshot deploy v0.1.0 -n <environment-name>
```

To see the outputs of the stack you just spun up:

```shell
$ moonshot status
```

Tear down your stack by running the following command:

```shell
$ moonshot delete
```

SSH into the first instance in your stack by running the following command:

```shell
$ moonshot ssh
```
